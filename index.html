  <p id="desc"> Over the past few months, Replit.com has changed their pricing drastically to the point where it is
    simply not
    viable.
    <br> We, along with many others, have used Replit for years, however, at its current point we are all looking for
    alternatives.
    <br> This website covers <b>what happened, a comparison, alternatives, and community quotes</b> to give perspective
    on the current issues of the platform.
  </p>

  <h3>What happened?</h3>
  <section id="whatHappened">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Nerfing Hacker Plan</h3>
      <p>
        The cutback of "Always On" instances from five to one hit Hacker Plan users hard. This shift took many projects
        offline, with users unable to pay the extra $292.20/year for 4 more always on repls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, reducing the number of Boosts included in the Hacker Plan from five to one, and reducing base repl
        specs to the same level as the free plan, unless you were actively inside the Replit workspace, left users
        wondering how Replit Hacker plan could anymore be a justified expense.
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Outrageous AI</h3>
      <p>
        Replit's enduring focus on AI and LLMs have put them in a state of throwing money at a losing battle.
        Ghostwriter is $10/month, yet it uses the same technology one can get for extraordinarily less from OpenAI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trending Repls have been heavily focused on AI, as well as the company's social media accounts & most heavily,
        their CEO.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it must be said, integrating AI has always been one of the main goals of Replit, right from day 1. It
        just feels overemphasised currently. AI is undoubtedly a very interesting space in computer science right now,
        however it's not the only one. A balance should be made such that AI exists within the product and community,
        but is not such an overwhelming majority of the focus as it is now.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>10x Hike in Power-ups</h3>
      <p>
        Replit's price hike for power-ups like Boosts and the Always On feature greatly affected its large student and
        budding coder user base. The increased costs, from 2 to 70 cycles/day, for a Boost, and 2 to 20 cycles/day, for
        the Always On feature, made these features less accessible, impacting the budget community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Replit has previously been very focused on their platform being used for new coders, with their motto
        "Bringing the next billion software creators online". However, this target audience has changed recently, with
        low budget beginner, student, and hobby developers being pushed away by the increased pricing.
      </p>


    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Reserved VM Pricing</h3>
      <p>
        The first offender of their Deployments is Reserved VMs. For the lowest tier, <b>you get 0.25vCPUs, 1GiB of RAM,
          and 10GiB of outbound data transfer.</b></p>
      <p>On platforms such as DigitalOcean and AWS, they can be more than 70%
        cheaper.</p>
      <div>
        <div class="comparison">
          <span class="vendor">Replit.com - $6.40/month</span>
          <br>
          <span class="value">0.25vCPU/1GB RAM/10GB transfer</span>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="comparison">
          <span class="vendor">DigitalOcean.com - $6.00/month</span>
          <br>
          <span class="value">1vCPU/1GB RAM/1TB transfer</span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Potentially Misleading "Autoscale"</h3>
      <p>Replit's version of a worker-like VM is Autoscale. You get <b>3 MILLION</b> free compute "units" per month with
        Hacker.</p>
      <p>
        If you're confused by what that means, everyone else is too. Replit's site says that most projects will use
        under 20 cents a month, however with a DDoS bypass or a "viral repl", you can easily incur costs upwards of
        hundreds of dollars. You can help mitigate this, by setting a limit on your monthly spending, but the lowest,
        as of writing this, is $10.</p>
      <p>
        On their pricing page, if you had the <b>Lowest Tier</b> Autoscale running for a full month with constant load,
        you would incur ~$64/month.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Uncompetitive Static</h3>
      <p>Replit's static deployments is just that - static site hosting. Just one small issue, and pay attention - all
        of these sites below are free.</p>
      <div class="comparison">
        <span class="vendor">Replit.com</span>
        <br>
        <span class="value">10GiB transfer</span>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="comparison">
        <span class="vendor">Github Pages</span>
        <br>
        <span class="value">100GiB transfer</span>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="comparison">
        <span class="vendor">Cloudflare Pages</span>
        <br>
        <span class="value">Unlimited* transfer</span>
      </div>

      <i>*Cloudflare's Pages obviously isn't unlimited, however will incur terabytes of transfer before you may get a
        friendly email.</i>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Egress Limits</h3>
      <p>
        On April 7, 2023, Replit set egress limits across all plans. Aimed at controlling outbound data transfer, this
        move faced backlash, especially from the Free tier users.
      </p>
      <p>
        With limits set at 10 GiB for Free, 50 GiB for Hacker, and 100 GiB for Pro tiers, many found them restrictive.
        Particularly those on the free plan, hosting popular projects.
      </p>


      <div class="comparison">
        <span class="vendor">Replit.com</span>
        <br>
        <span class="value">$0.1/GiB, 10GiB FREE</span>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="comparison">
        <span class="vendor">DigitalOcean.com</span>
        <br>
        <span class="value">$0.01/GiB, 500GiB FREE</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Replit.dev</h3>
      <p>
        The final blow came when Replit announced that your repls could only stay online when you are actively within
        the workspace, now Replit Deployments stand as Replit's only hosting option.
      </p>
      <p>
        This decision seemed to counter Replit's user-friendly ethos, sparking widespread confusion and shock within the
        community. Especially as they promised to <a href="https://blog.replit.com/glitch#~text=But%20we%20will%20never%20ban%20pinging%20to%20force%20people%20to%20upgrade%20by%20taking%20away%20features.:~:text=But%20we%20will%20never%20ban%20pinging%20to%20force%20people%20to%20upgrade%20by%20taking%20away%20features.">
        never force users to move away from pingers to a paid product</a>, which is exactly was just been done. Users
        can no longer ping their hosted repl's repl.co url, and instead must move to the paid deployments product to
        continue hosting on Replit.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Misleading Bounties</h3>
      <p>
        The top 50 most "rewarding" open bounties are all stale, having been left open for months with no accepted
        applicant. Replit still shows this on their "$60k+ OPEN" tag, even though there is no hope of acquiring this
        money from those stale bounties.
      </p>
      <p>Another issue is that the payout is shown in USD and Cycles, but doesn't take into account the 25%-15% cashout
        fee, giving a slightly misleading expectation to new bounty hunters who aren't yet aware of the fee.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Terrible community management</h3>
      <p>
        The 16k+ member Replit Discord community fell to bits after the moderation team wasn't paid any more than their
        Hacker plan, all nerfed and shiny at $7/month. Understandably, moderators striked, causing Replit to abandon
        control of the community server altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Replit Reps program was abandoned too, with it disbanding after only 1 and a half cohort cycles.
      <p>
        Jams were reduced from events like <b>Kajam</b> and <b>#madewithreplit</b> to AI hackathons that a 14 year old
        won with school & no prior experience. Prize pools have dropped from over $10k to around $2k per event, lowering
        the incentive.
